== hi-triangle-gles-emscripten ==

An adaptation of a hello triangle example here: https://www.khronos.org/assets/uploads/books/openglr_es_20_programming_guide_sample.pdf
set up to be cross-compiled for WebGL using emscripten.

== To build for the web ==

The only requirement is an updated
version of emscripten. Download the emscripten sdk and
build the master version. Run `source emsdk_env.sh`
in any shell before building this project.

The script "easy_build_web.sh" should work out of the
box after this.

== To build for native ==

You must have mesa or OpenGL hardware drivers.
You must support for GLES2.
You must have SDL2.

The makefile searches your system for the library "GLESv2".
On mint this is provided to me by mesa, in this lib:

sudo apt-get install libegl1-mesa-dev

More info here: https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/mesa/10.1.3-0ubuntu0.4

SDL2 can be easily installed also

sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev
